Process Management
		
	void OS_Yield(void):
		context switching
			changing sp
		stop processing but do not terminate, wait for next CPU cycle
	
Periodic and Device Processes
idea:
check the devices and their times, next device time goes into global time holder
when checking PPP, check it's time. If less that globaltime then run for it's lenght, if > then run for global time

interrupts

context switch interrupt handler should be scheduler (set to 1 not 0)

only need pc when restoring process

NEW, READY, RUNNING, WAITING/BLOCKED states for processes

test FIFO

remove GetPID // we might want to keep it, because it's built into other things now

timer

semaphore waiting queue
	same as init fifo????

monolithic heap
