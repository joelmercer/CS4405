Process Management
		
	void OS_Yield(void):
		context switching
			changing sp
		stop processing but do not terminate, wait for next CPU cycle
	
Periodic and Device Processes
idea:
check the devices and their times, next device time goes into global time holder
when checking PPP, check it's time. If less that globaltime then run for it's lenght, if > then run for global time

context switch interrupt handler should be scheduler (set to 1 not 0) - mostly working



semaphore waiting queue
	same as init fifo????


os_wait & os_yeild shouldn't be the same
